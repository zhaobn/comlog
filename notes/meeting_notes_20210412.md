# Meeting notes (2021-04-12)

## Current status

- Complete runs take a long time: ~20min for checking one data point
- Ground truth is quite complicated, haven't been able to get it for now (actually wasn't able to complete a full run)
  - Batch processing fails to find a rule that is consistent with all the observations (this may be solved if I can actually run a long chain)
  - Order matters (it might not order if I'd able to run a long chain)?

## Plan

- Carefully design data
- Let the normative model run as long as it needs
- Process model online update?
