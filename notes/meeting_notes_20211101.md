- Comput Brain Behav acceptance :tada:
- [WHY-21 workshop](https://why21.causalai.net) submission review ([Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_jfqJCaYIBhxSm5qxbaCMuxl5tfO1hXHYpmICBEpZUE/edit?usp=sharing))
- Experiment 1 data initial look ([R Markdown](https://eco.ppls.ed.ac.uk/~s1941626/exp_1_analysis.html))
- Experiment 1 free responses ([Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xmfK-JrVznHkPfKPoicelXOW5Mj252G2TtY6O9PP2tM/edit?usp=sharing))
  - Code alternative rules?
  - Local updates: for all three conditions, who once landed on the wrong direction in Phase A, can hardly get it right after Phase B.
  - "Addition" bias: in the combine condition, people do just "add" the two sub-rules together; the minus relationship is easier to learn than mult
  - People seem to seek complicate guesses when they are uncertain
- Modeling fitting (?)
- Alternative models
  - Rational rules
  - Similarity-based guesses
- Follow-up experiment ideas
  - Replication: swap strip and dot's causal power => dot*block-stripe
  - Control generalization trial's presence
  - Introduce synthesis phase
  - Challenge additive
