## Current project

* Chris comment: use log probs instead of log likelihoods (?)
* Grammar-based search-only results differentiate between `combine` and `construct` conditions, while people and AG model don't
* How to interpret [Exp 3 results](https://eco.ppls.ed.ac.uk/~s1941626/exp_3_analysis.html)
* TODO list
  * Experiment 4 data collection
  * PCFG model (?)
  * Similarity-based non-symbolic model
  * Linear regression
  * Gaussian progress
  * Fit the two hyperparameters for AG model (grid search?)
  * Decide **variations of AG model**: by allowing exceptions or `ifElse` rules we could cover larger hypothesis space of people. Do we want it in this paper and how?
* Potential target journal?
