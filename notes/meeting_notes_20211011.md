- Revision
- Main experiment
  - Updates for phase 2: added introduction, comprehension question, and a reminder in the second self-report
  - To get optimal generalization trials: run model with `exceptions = 0, 1, 2` for the three learning conditions, get all intermediate programs (alternative hypothesis) and then use EIG-greedy to decide generalization trials
- Modeling: in learning phase 2, what's the starting library? Sample from the aggregated posterior library?
- Pre-registration
