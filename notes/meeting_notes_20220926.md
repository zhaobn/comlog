# Notes (2022-09-26)

## Feedback from Noah

Concerns:

* The experiment didn't distinguish sub-part sharing of AG from PCFG
* PCFG + particle filters (small samples) in deconstruct could do well

Links to make:

* Test on large in-context language models
* Cultural priors, math literacy, langauge (self-reports) as window to cognition
* Teaching (in cover story / instruction)

## Feeback Tom's lab

* Robert Hawkins: [DreamCoder path-dependence}(https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/file/1c104b9c0accfca52ef21728eaf01453-Paper.pdf)
* Natalia Velez: how to extend the model in cultural evolution / social settings

## Draft status

* Incorporate Noah's comments
* SI to be done
