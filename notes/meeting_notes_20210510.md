## Experiment design

Learning phase 1: Agent makes Recipients larger (Fix agent; make use of Mysterious stone finding)

Learning phase 2: White Agents make Recipients larger (Contrast varying edge property or color property)

Learning phase 3: White Agents make Recipients larger & Agent's number of edges decide how much a Recipient enlarges

Learning phase 4: Black Agents shrink the Recipients
