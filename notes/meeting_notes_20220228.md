# Notes (2022-02-28)

* Results overview: <https://eco.ppls.ed.ac.uk/~s1941626/results_overview.html>
* Another theorizing perspective: depth=1 search as a feature of our model rather than an implementation choice? "balance between stored units and structure building"
* Submission plan
  * _PNAS_, then _Cognition_?
  * Will put together a draft based on cogsci materials & new data
  * Hyperparameters for our adaptor grammar model: use Liang et al.'s, or grid-search them?
  * Finish alternative models (will call for help/check when needed)
* Talk at Tobi's lab went well; next week in London (Sat-Thur)
