2,355,construct,848668,23,female,I think that its a multiplication sum.

4,616,flip,513254,29,female,the amount of lines on the egg takes away the same amount of lines on the sticks  for example one line magic egg takes away one square off the line  ,subtraction,1 spot on the egg does not do anything  two dots on the egg adds two blocks  3 dots on the egg adds two blocks,add_2
4,617,flip,1167108,22,male,An increase of the stripes by one on the eggs results in a decrease in the size of the stick by one bar.,subtraction,The number of dots on the eggs multiplied by the number of bars making up the original stick equals the number of bars making up the stick after the egg touches it.,mult
4,618,flip,1183728,30,female,The more stripes it has it makes the length of the stick shorter.,complex,Some dots increase the length of the stick while others stay the same length.,complex
4,619,combine,307467,24,female,the first with one spot does not change anything the other 2 add 2 lengths extra to each stick,add_2,the amount of lines on the egg are how many lengths the stick reduces by,subtraction
4,620,combine,480590,42,female,if the eggs have an even number of spots they can make the sticks longer by 2 units; if they contain an odd number they lengthen by 0 0r 1 unit only,complex,The lines on the eggs corresponds to the number of units the sticks decrease in length by,subtraction
4,621,combine,681893,20,female,the magic eggs multiply the number of stick segments by the number of dots on the egg. number of segments after contact (n) = number of dots (d) x number of segments before contact (sg),mult,the number of segments after contact (n) = (the number of dots on the egg (d) x the number of segments before contact (sg)) - the number of red lines on the egg (l). n=(d x sg)-l The stick is multiplied by the number of dots on the egg and then loses a segment for each red line on the egg.,ground_truth
4,622,combine,341512,21,female,2 dots + on the magic eggs increase stick length by 2,add_2,for each stripe in the magic egg the stick loses a segment,subtraction
4,623,combine,601326,52,female,When there is an even number of spots the eggs double when they touch the sticks.,complex,i still think it depends how many eggs there are but my last theory is wrong.  i still think it might have something to do with odd or even numbers of eggs.,complex
4,624,combine,571852,31,male,the egg doubles depending on the number and how many eggs,complex,the more lines the more the boxes get removed,complex
4,625,combine,588887,57,female,I think the egg had to have more than one dot to grow but dont know why one with 2 dots grew to 4 and the one with 3 dots grew to 3,uncertain,The stripes take away the number of sticks that there are stripes,subtraction
4,626,combine,865703,38,female,You multiply the dots by the sticks ie. 1) 1 x 3 which = 3 so the stick stays the same. 2) 2 x 2 =4 so the stick increases in size. 3) 3 x 1 = 3 so the stick stays the same.,mult,The dots multiply and the stripes subtract ie. 4)1 x 3 = 3 then subtract 1 and you are left with 2 blocks. 5) 1 x 3 =3 then subtract 2 and you are left with 1 block. 6)1 x 3 = 3 then subtract 3 and you are left with 0 blocks.,ground_truth
4,627,combine,905111,45,female,The number of dots indicates the multiplication factor of the segments so if there are 2 dots the segments are increased by a factor of 2.,mult,If the dots are on there own (so no stripes present) then the segments are increased by multiplying by the amount of dots.  If stripes are present then the number of segments decrease by the amount of stripes that are present. When there are stripes and more than 1 dot I would predict that you multiply the number of segments by the dots but then reduce by the amount by the amount of stripes.,ground_truth
4,628,combine,703827,52,female,I think the number of spots are multiplied by the number of rows on the stick so 1x3 is no change. 2x2 increases to 4 3 x1 increases the stick to 3.,mult,The spots are multiplied so one spot multiples the blocks by one therefore no change. 2 spots multiples by two so for example 2 spots hitting two blocks lengthens it to four. The lines need to be subtracted. So for example two spots hits two blocks making four but if there is one stripe it gets taken away so the final line is three blocks long.,ground_truth
4,629,combine,512963,60,male,They increase the length of the sticks by the number of dots in the egg,complex,Each line removes one segment in the stick.,subtraction
4,630,combine,749574,25,male,An odd number of dots causes the length of the sticks to be odd and an even number of dots causes the length of the sticks to be even. ,complex,An equal increase in the number of stripes leads to an equal decrease of the stickss length.,subtraction
4,631,combine,581095,26,female,even number of circles in the eggs doubles the planks,complex,if the dot is higher up in the egg then more planks,complex
4,632,combine,442224,29,female,I think the magic eggs would change the length of the stick when it touch the stick. ,uncertain,When the magic eggs touch the stick it changes the number of the stick.,uncertain
