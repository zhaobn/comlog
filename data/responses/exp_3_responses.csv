","It appears as I said above that the number spots in the egg directly corresponds to the number of segments removed from the stick.  However it now appears that the number of stripes present in the egg provides a multiplication factor so if there is 1 stripe the number of segments is multiplied by 1 (hence no change in the first set of magic eggs shown before my first prediction) but 2 stripes multiplies the number of segments by 2 as shown in test 5 and 3 stripes multiplies the number of segments by 3 as shown in test 6.","none",11
