"5",366,"comp_mult_reverse","The number of dots dictate how many segments of the stick will decrease.","The number of lines on the egg multiplies the segments of the stick by the number of lines. So example 6 is 3 (number of lines) times 1 (length of stick).","There is no indication whether or not the subtraction or multiplication occurs first.",9

"10",371,"comp_const","The amount of circles on the egg matters because it indicates how many sticks will be removed. One circle means one stick is removed two circles mean two sticks are removed and three circles mean three sticks are removed. The orange line remains the same for all tests and seemingly has no effect but I cannot say it doesnt matter because I havent tested any eggs without a single orange line on them. Maybe the orange line is necessary for the reaction to take place?","A single orange line causes no change. (multiplies by one) Two orange lines causes the stick to double its length. Three orange lines causes the stick to triple its length.","Nope",9
"11",372,"comp_const","That the number of spots on the egg is equal to the number of segments of the stick it will remove","That the number of stripes indicates the number of stick segments to multiply by","no comments",7
"12",373,"comp_mult_reverse","my first thought is to find the properties of the egg the orange line is constant and the dots change so the dots indicate an amount and the orange line must indicate what to do with that amount in this case the orange line means negative     1(dot) -(orange line) 3(green stick) = 2 (green stick)","if the orange line is more then one and has no dots add 2 to the green stick ?","would love to know the correct answer ",1

"15",376,"comp_mult","So far I believe it is the number of dots on the eggs that cause the sticks to change for example the amount of dots = the amount of segments taken away.","The amount of dots= the amount of segments you minus. If there are no dots present then you times (x) the amount of segments by the amount of stripes.","I could be wrong with my predictions because i times the amounts of segments first then minused them and it could be the other way around bur regardless i enjoyed the task. ",9
"16",377,"comp_mult","For the magic egg to gain a spot it needs to touch the number of stick segments equivalent to how many spots it wants to gain. For example to gain one spot it needs to touch one segment but to gain two spots it needs to touch two segments and so on. ","Im stuck. When the magic egg has 2 lines I thought it might double when it touches the stick segments. But then for 3 lines there are 3 segments and 4 segments for 2 lines so Im lost. ","NA",4
"17",378,"comp_mult_reverse","Best guess so far: stripe count corresponds to a mathematical operation number of dots corresponds to the number of times to perform it. One stripe means subtract 1. Or if n is the number of dots 1 stripe means subtract n.","More confident that 1 stripe means remove n where n is number of dots. Not enough information for more stripes - could be that 2 stripes no dots double or add 2; 3 stripes no dots triple or add 2. Although thinking about it an alternative model which explains all the above: A stripes B dots means x = Ax - B where x is starting line length x is resulting line length. Im going with that.","Interesting. The lack of example for no-stripes really threw off my model when it came to those questions; ended up thinking of that as a special case unless further examples became available so answered the last question using the previous model which I at that point knew wasnt right!",8
"18",379,"comp_const","As the dots on the eggs increase per absolute unit so the squares decrease in exactly the same measure.","The lines on the egg act in a multiplicative effect. The squares are being multiplied by the absolute number of lines on the egg.","",7
"19",380,"comp_mult","I think that the dots are an indicator of how many segments of stick to remove. i.e 1 dot = remove 1 segment from stick 3 dots = remove 3 segments from stick","I think it goes as follows  1 line = dont increasedecrease segments on stick. 2 lines = double amount of segments on stick 3 lines = triple amount of segments on stick and so on","no. it was fun.",8
"20",381,"comp_mult","one stripe on an egg appears to mean that for each dot that accompanies it you subtract a segment","both lines and dots on an egg appear to have ability to alter segment count on a stick but it appears the dots subtract in combination with lines and the lines multiply segments on their own","that was interesting thanks its hard to estimate how difficult it was  if I dont know how well i did ",3
