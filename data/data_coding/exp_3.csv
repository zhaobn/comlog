For example 1 black dot on an egg equals 1 segment taken away from the stick.,subtract,subtraction,If there are two lines on an egg then it adds two segments to the stick.

The second egg has 2 dots and the stick shrinks by 2. The third egg has 3 dots and the stick shrinks by 3.,subtract,subtraction,The black dots on the first 3 magic eggs caused lines to subtract from the stick but the orange lines cause the stick to multiply.

483,sub,Each spot reduces the length of the stick by 1 part.,subtract,subtraction,The number of sticks multiplies the by number of stripes,mult,mult
484,mult,More than two strips on the eggs affect the length of the stick. If there is more than one stripe an extra two is added to the length of the stick.,add_2,add_2,For every dot there is a segment of the stick taken away. ,subtract,subtraction
485,mult,Multiply the number of stripes by the number of squares in the before state to get to the after state,mult,mult,Number of squares at the start minus the number of dots at the start,subtract,subtraction
486,mult,Eggs with two or three lines seem to add two additional stick segments.,add_2,add_2,The black dots remove stick segments while only one line does not add any segments.,complex,subtraction
487,sub,(The number of dots that touch stripes) and (the number of loose floating dots) are maybe 2 calculators? Where the amount of floating dots marks an amount to be removed as well as the amount touching the stripe marking an amount to be removed?,complex,position,The stripes indicate the multiplier of the amount of sticks there were before,mult,comp
488,sub,When there is one line on the egg (like in this test) the amount of dots on the egg determines how many segments of the stick are lost (so how much it is shortened),complex,subtraction,The stick segments (length) are multiplied by the amount of lines on the egg. This seems to be the case as long as no dots are present,mult,mult
489,sub,The number of dots on each egg determines how many segments the sticks decrease by. For example one dot decreases by one segment two dots decreases by two segments and three dots decreases the stick by three segments,subtract,subtraction,If there is one stripe then the number of segments remains the same. If there are two stripes then the length of the stick is doubled. If there are three stripes then the length is tripled on the stick.,mult,mult
490,sub,I think the number of spots in the egg is related to the number of segments removed from the sticks.  An egg with 1 spot removes 1 segment of stickan egg with 2 spots removes 2 segments of the stick etc.  I cant see that the stripe has an effect at the moment. ,subtract,subtraction,It appears as I said above that the number spots in the egg directly corresponds to the number of segments removed from the stick.  However it now appears that the number of stripes present in the egg provides a multiplication factor so if there is 1 stripe the number of segments is multiplied by 1 (hence no change in the first set of magic eggs shown before my first prediction) but 2 stripes multiplies the number of segments by 2 as shown in test 5 and 3 stripes multiplies the number of segments by 3 as shown in test 6.,alt,comp
491,mult,The more lines inside the egg seem to increase length,complex,increase,each dot decreases the length by 1,subtract,subtraction
492,sub,its the number of sticks minus (-) the number of dots in the magic egg. So if the number of sticks is 3 and the number of dots in the magic egg is 2 the remaining segments of the stick will be = 3-2 = 1 segment.,subtract,subtraction,Its the number of segments in the stick multiplied by the number of stripes in the magic egg minus the number of dots in the magic egg. So if : stripes = 3 dots = 2 stick segments = 1  it will be 1 x 3 - 2 = 1 segment.  ,gt,alt
494,mult,long lines (eg. on test 1 and in the centre of test 3) do nothing to the sticks. short lines (eg. on test 2 and on the outer edges of test 3) add +1 to the stick - so for test 2 and test 3 which both have 2 short lines 2 sections were added to the sticks,complex,add_2,I still think that short lines add +1 to the sticks. Now I think that each dot removes a section regardless of where it is placed within the egg,subtract,subtraction
452,mult,Maybe the length of the stick becomes the number of segments it was originally multiplied by the number of stripes on the egg?,mult,mult,The number of dots on the egg should be subtracted from the length of the stick. So the length = (number of initial segments x number of stripes) - number of dots,gt,model
496,mult,The number of stripes on the egg is a multiplier.,mult,mult,The number of spots indicates a subtraction.,subtract,subtraction
497,mult,Number of lines increases power beyond having just one,complex,increase,Spots are minuses to the effect,subtract,subtraction
498,mult,1 stripe equals no change or zero 2 stripes adds 2 to the length and 3 stripes brings the total length to 3,complex,add_2,This time the dot will reduce the length by 1 overriding the stripe. 1 dot equals minus 1 of the length 2 dots minus 2 of the length and so on,subtract,subtraction
436,mult,The segments are multiplied by the amount of stripes on the egg to give the end result (e.g 1*3=3 2*2=4 3*1=3),mult,mult,The segments are multiplied by the stripes then the amount of dots are subtracted.,gt,model
500,mult,The number of stripes change the length of the stick - one stripe does not change the length whereas 2 and 3 stripes both make the stick 2 segments longer.,add_2,add_2,2 or 3 stripes on the eggs make the sticks 2 segments longer whilst 1 stripe on the egg keeps the stick the same length.  Spots on the egg cause the stick to become shorter by the same number of segments as there are spots.,complex,add_2
501,mult,egg with one line has no effect. egg with two lines will double stick length. egg with three lines will triple the stick length.,mult,mult,eggs with lines multiply the stick length by the number of lines in the egg. eggs with lines and dots multiply the stick length by the number of lines and then remove a stick length per dot according to the number of dots in the egg.,gt,model
502,mult,The egg with two stripes doubles the length of the stick. The egg with three stripes equates to the same length of the stick. The first egg has no bearing on the stick length.,complex,description,Depending on the number of dots in the egg the sticks are reduced respectively ie the egg with one dot reduces the stick by one segment. The egg with two dots reduces the stick by two segments and the third removes the stick altogether. The dots are the main property that matter.,subtract,subtraction
439,mult,I think that having more than one stripe results in the egg increasing the length (number of segments) on the stick. One stripe has no effect but 2 or 3 stripes increases the segment by 2. ,add_2,add_2,The number of stripes on the eggs are the number by which the number of segments on the stick must be multiplied example if there are 2 stripes multiply the number of segments by 2. Then you subtract the number of the dots on the eggs from the segment length.  The stripes generally increase the length of the sticks whereas the dots decrease the length. ,gt,model
