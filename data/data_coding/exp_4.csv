608,mult,The magic eggs that have more than one spot on them add two segments of sticks to the already existing ones. However their lenth remains the same. When the magic egg has only 1 spot it has no effect on the sticks but as soon as there is more than 1 spot on the egg then two sticks are added to the segment increasing their length.,add_2,relative,When the magic egg has a single spot no sticks are added to the segment. And once there is more than one two sticks are added. When the egg has both spot and a stripes the number of stripes that are shown on the egg are then subtracted from the segment of sticks. So anytime there was a single spot it has no effect on the segment at all. However stripes on the egg indicate the number of sticks that must be subtracted from the segment.,complex,relative
611,mult,the length of the sticks will increase,complex,increase,More eggs are closer to the lines. The lines will be longer.,complex,position
623,mult,When there is an even number of spots the eggs double when they touch the sticks.,complex,parity,i still think it depends how many eggs there are but my last theory is wrong.  i still think it might have something to do with odd or even numbers of eggs.,complex,parit

589,mult,Two dots create two extra sticks. Three dots create one extra stick,complex,description,The similarities are when theyre is lines in the magic eggs they remove a stick. When there is just the magic egg they add sticks.,complex,relative
595,mult,The more amount of eggs the length of stick increases. For example 3 eggs equals three blocks of stick.,complex,increase,Stripes in the eggs decreases the size of the stick.,complex,decrease

519,sub,If the spot is touching the side of a line it decreases the number of segments by one. If the dot is in the middle of a line it will decrease the amount of segments by the number of lines in the egg.,complex,position,dots increase segments whereas stripes decrease segments,complex,mix

563,mult,The stick may grow dependant upon how many dots are in the circle. Also depends if one of the circles in the dot makes contact with the stick if it does it seems to grow if it doesnt then no growth.,complex,relative,The amount of lines in the egg once it makes contact with the stick is how many blocks the stick decreases by.,complex,position
574,sub,I think it is just random whether sticks elongate or not therefore it doesnt matter how many spots or stripes there are. These are magic eggs after all,uncertain,uncertain,it has nothing to do with the spots or stripes there is no logical pattern to the magic,uncertain,uncertain

588,sub,I feel the sticks and eggs are both important. As long as the eggs are within the inside of the red sticks it will decrease the green blocks by however many red sticks are present within the circle. For example 1 egg and 1 red stick decreases the green blocks by 1. 2 sticks and 1 circle within the sticks decreases it by two etc. ,complex,relative,If there is 1 egg touching the right side there is no movement or change in blocks. So If there is 1 egg that is touching the right side but 2 not touching and floating anywhere else then the blocks will increase by 2 eggs + the original amount of blocks that were there in the beginning.,complex,position
613,sub,Stick numbers seem to match the segment number.  At the moment it doesnt seem that the spots in the eggs affect the number of segments or the stick length.,complex,uncertain,Now I am entirely unsure about the casual relationship between the two. There doesnt seem to be any logic that is immediately jumping out at me with regards to the numbers spots and the number of segments after the egg has moved. I am currently struggling to figure out the relationship.  My previous observation was based on the number of sticks and then the number of segments. So without any sticks whatsoever and different numbers of dots I am officially confused.,uncertain,uncertain
