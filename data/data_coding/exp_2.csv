273,comp_mult,The number of spots on the egg is the multiplier for the stick length. For example 1 spot changes nothing 2 spots doubles the length 3 spots triple the length etc.,mult,mult,The number of spots is a multiplier and the number of stripes is a subtractor. If l is the length of the stick p is  of spots and t is  of stripes the new length of the stick = lp-t,gt,ground_truth
270,comp_mult,So the dots equal numbers and the segments are numbers and the circles dots are multiplies by the first about of segmentsnumbers which results in the lengthening or shortening. Basically multiply the amount of dots by the amount of segments.,mult,mult,The dots are multiplies by the amount of segments then minused by the amount of stripes,gt,ground_truth
204,comp_mult,The number of stick segments increases when it is multiplied by the number or spots on the egg.   So for the first egg there was only 1 spot and 3 stick segments - 1x3=3 sticks second egg 2 spots and 2 segments - 2x2=4 stick segments  third egg - 3 spots and 1 segment - 3x1=3 segments,mult,mult,So the spots still multiply the original stick segments. e.g. 1 spot x 2 stick segments= 2 stick segments  However the stripes on the eggs deducts.  First you multiply the sticks by the spots on the egg. Then take away the the same number of stick segments to the same number of stripes on the egg.   For example   in exampletest 6 there is 1 stripe 3 spots and 1 stick segment therefore:  3 (spots) x 1(segment) = 3 segments  3 (segments) - 1 (stripe) = 2 segments  ,gt,ground_truth
222,comp_mult,multiply number of dots by number of stick segments.  so if 2 stick segments meet 3 dots becomes 6 stick segments,mult,mult,Again number of dots multiplies number of stick segments.  But number of lines within the egg decreases numerically number of stick segments,gt,ground_truth

316,comp_mult,My guess is that depending on the number of spots within the egg its the number of spots multiplied by the number of sticks. So if one egg has two spots and there are two sticks its 2 spots x 2 sticks = 4 sticks. ,mult,mult,The spots in the egg are multiplied by the number of sticks. However if there is a stick within the egg then the total number that was multiplied is subtracted by the amount of sticks within the egg. ,gt,ground_truth

255,comp_const,That the number of segments before the test is multiplied by the number of dots on the egg. ,mult,mult,I think the number of segments before are multiplied by the number of dots on the egg. I think the number of lines on the egg is then subtracted. ,gt,ground_truth
350,comp_mult,The number of dots multiplies the number of stick segments. For test 1: 1 x 3= 3 so stick does not change. test 2: 2 x 2= 4 so stick becomes 4 segments long. test 3: 3 x 1= 3 so stick becomes 3 segments long.,mult,mult,The number of dots multiplied by the segments of the original stick = new stick length. Then minus the number of lines on the magic egg. test 4: (1 x 3)-3=0. test 5: (2x2)-2=2. test 6: (3x1)-1=2.,gt,ground_truth
355,comp_mult,I think that its a multiplication sum. So the number of dots in the egg is multiplied by the number of blocks in the stick so when the egg hits the stick the number of dots gets multiplied by the number of blocks on the stick and then blocks are added to made the sum correct. For example in test 3 theres 3 dots and one block so when the egg with 3 dots hits the block it calculates (3 x 1) = 3 hence the stick grows to become 3 blocks long,mult,mult,So i think the same rule applies as before but the lines on the eggs is a subtract 1. So in test 6 the 3 dots would have been multiplied by the 1 block to make the stick 3 blocks long but the line on the egg subtracts 1 block leaving the stick only 2 blocks long,gt,ground_truth

For example 3 dots and 2 stripes hitting 3 sitcks would be 3x3=9-2=7.

In the second test the egg touching the stick had no effect on the number of segments on the stick. The egg has an equal number of stripes and spots. In the third test the egg caused the stick to grow by one segment. The egg in this test has three dots and one stripe. My guess is that stripes on an egg equate to the number of segments it will take away from the stick or that the stripes reduce the number of segments on the stick while dots on the egg cause the stick to grow more segments (although there doesnt seem to be a correlation between the number of dots and number of segments added to the stick).,complex,mix,In the first set of tests the stripes seemed to indicate that the number of stripes equated to the number of segments the stick would reduce by if it touched the egg however in the second test there were only dots on the egg which increased the number of segments on the stick.

Stripes with no spots at all on them also remove a segment of the stick.  In example 1 there are three stripes which remove segments of the stick. One dot is in the centre of a stripe so it has no effect on the stripe.  In example 2 there are two stripes with dots on different ends.

275,comp_mult_reverse,the  number of stripes relates to the the number of segments that will change. the number of dots controls if segments are added or removed depending on the number of dots reletive to the already existing segments so if theres more dots than segments at the start segments equal to the number of stripes will be added and if theres less than the existing segments you remove segments equal to the number of stripes. if equal there is no change.,complex,relative,i dont think theres an actual rule i think the segment assignments are random.,uncertain,not_sure
