179,61006c7ded56391a96ff75a5,comp_const,I think the number of lines corresponds to the percentage of stick length there will be. Each line is worth 100. So one line means 100 of the three sticks meaning it doesnt change. Secondly two lines mean 200 so the two sticks double to four. Lastly three lines mean 300 so one stick triples to three.,complex,description,I still think the lines on the eggs mean the amount the sticks are increasing but with one line the sticks remain the same by showing 100 of what was there. The dots subtract one block for each dot.,complex,subtraction,,,,,,

192,60f816ff1fa74fcfab532378,comp_mult_reverse,The first egg made 3 segments of the stick disappear this had one line and 3 dots. The second egg didnt make a change and it had two lines and two dots. The third egg made the stick longer by one segment and it had one dot and three lines. I think that the number of dots if the egg has an odd number of lines corresponds to the change that will happen to the stick. So for example if there is one line and one dot then the stick will lose one segment. If there are three lines and two dots then the stick will increase by two segments. It doesnt matter how many dots are on an egg if there are two lines on it but Im not sure about this part. The sticks segments dots and lines were all the same so that might be an exception. ,complex,parity,I think it is that the number of lines on the egg is a multiplication and then the number of dots is a subtraction. So the original number of segments gets multiplied by the number of lines and then you have to minus the number of dots from that number and that equals what the overall number of segments will be. ,gt,mult,,,,,,
