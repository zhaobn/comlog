For example in the first example the magic egg subtracts 3 and there are three lines. And in the third example the magic egg adds 1 line and there is only one line in the egg. Beyond that Im baffled.","Dots that arent touching or close to the edge of the egg add segments to the line.","I honestly have no idea what the correct answers were.

"161",355,"5f384f00a1276934daedf319","comp_mult","I think that its a multiplication sum. So the number of dots in the egg is multiplied by the number of blocks in the stick so when the egg hits the stick the number of dots gets multiplied by the number of blocks on the stick and then blocks are added to made the sum correct. For example in test 3 theres 3 dots and one block so when the egg with 3 dots hits the block it calculates (3 x 1) = 3 hence the stick grows to become 3 blocks long","So i think the same rule applies as before but the lines on the eggs is a subtract 1. So in test 6 the 3 dots would have been multiplied by the 1 block to make the stick 3 blocks long but the line on the egg subtracts 1 block leaving the stick only 2 blocks long","NA",11
